This project showcases an end-to-end Power BI workflow using the AdventureWorks dataset (Maven Analytics version). The process begins with connecting multiple Excel sources in Power Query, where data was cleaned and shaped by removing duplicates, splitting and formatting columns, and creating calculated fields such as profit margins and customer names. A star schema data model was built with a central Sales fact table connected to dimension tables for Customers, Products, Territories, Returns, and Calendar, with proper relationships and a marked date table for time intelligence. DAX measures were created to calculate key business metrics including Total Sales, Total Profit, Profit Margin, Return Rate, and time-based measures like YTD Sales, MTD Sales, Previous Year Sales, and Sales Growth %, leveraging functions like CALCULATE, DIVIDE, SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR, and DATESYTD. The final dashboard includes interactive KPIs, regional sales breakdowns, product category performance, and return analysis, supported by slicers for year, region, and product category to enable self-service exploration. Advanced visuals such as maps, decomposition trees, line and clustered column charts, and KPI cards provide a clear, actionable view of sales performance. The project demonstrates how Power BI can transform raw operational data into meaningful insights for strategic decision-making.
